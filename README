Implemented syscalls(date, pgtPrint), demand paging (toggleable) and copy-on-write.

User programs for testing - mydate, mypgtPrint, mydemandPage, myCOW

Implemented command ‘set’ to help with observations and debugging.
set i 1             prints information about demand paging, copy on write and forks
set d 0             switches off demand paging. (set d 1 will switch it back on)
set s 1             prints syscall names (ignoring write). (set s 0 will switch it off)
